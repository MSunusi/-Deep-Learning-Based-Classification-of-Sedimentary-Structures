## ðŸ§  Overview

This project presents a deep learning pipeline that identifies and classifies sedimentary structures in geological core images using the YOLOv11 object detection model. The model helps geologists and researchers automatically recognize key sedimentary features critical for understanding depositional environments and supporting hydrocarbon exploration.

We annotated and trained on 222 geological core images with 5 classes:

- Cross-bedded Sandstones
- Low-angle Cross-bedded Sandstones
- Massive Sandstones
- Parallel-laminated Sandstones
- Mud Drapes

Each class was identified based on distinct sedimentary textures and features, derived from drill cores typically used in field geology.
